- Engine optimisation: fast and memory-undemanding
- WYSIWYG story flow editor
- WYSIWYG script editor
- The engine's own story-oriented script language
- Easy convertion between visual script editing and text script editing.
- Pragmatic resource managing: what is needed to be used, is used. What will be needed to use in the future, gets ready in advance.
